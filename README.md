### About me
I'm a data scientist, which basically means I wrangle numbers until they tell me their secrets. I'm a bit of a spreadsheet sorcerer, a chart charmer, and a data whisperer. I find beauty in the messy, and I can predict the future (sometimes, maybe).

### Projects

- [AI-Powered Accident Analysis for Industrial Safety](https://github.com/charanakash/AI-Powered-Accident-Analysis-for-Industrial-Safety)
<br> This project developed for an AI-powered chatbot for industrial safety. By analyzing accident reports through NLP, the chatbot identifies key risk factors, such as equipment failure or human error. This empowers employees to report potential hazards, promotes knowledge sharing, and ultimately helps prevent future accidents. The chatbot also provides a user-friendly interface for reporting and accessing safety information.

- [Support ticket categorization system](https://github.com/charanakash/Support-ticket-categorization-system/tree/main)
<br> To address the challenges of growing support ticket volume, a system was developed to automate ticket categorization, prioritization, and initial responses. Utilizing machine learning (NLP, sentiment analysis), the system accurately classifies tickets, automates tagging, and prioritizes based on urgency and sentiment. This resulted in significantly improved response times, increased customer satisfaction, and enhanced agent productivity while providing valuable customer insights.

- [Face-Recognition](https://github.com/charanakash/Face-Recognition)
<br> Company X required a high-quality dataset for developing a robust face recognition system. To achieve this, a large and diverse dataset of aligned faces was collected from Pinterest. The dlib library was utilized for facial landmark detection and alignment. After rigorous cleaning and processing, a dataset of 10,770 images of 100 individuals was created, significantly contributing to the success of Company X's face recognition project.

- [OCR-in-Street-View-Imagery](https://github.com/charanakash/OCR-in-Street-View-Imagery)
<br> This project aimed to improve house number recognition in street view imagery by developing a robust OCR model. Utilizing the challenging SVHN dataset, we explored deep learning architectures (CNNs) and implemented data augmentation techniques to overcome real-world obstacles like varying lighting and image quality. The resulting model achieved 95% accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for enhancing map construction and location-based services.

- [Automated-Cast-Identification-for-Movie-Streaming-Platform](https://github.com/charanakash/Automated-Cast-Identification-for-Movie-Streaming-Platform)
<br> Company X aimed to enhance user experience by enabling real-time actor identification within its movie streaming service. This involved developing a system that accurately detects and recognizes faces in movie scenes using computer vision techniques. By leveraging deep learning models and optimizing for performance, the project successfully delivered a user-friendly feature with 95% accuracy in face detection, significantly improving user satisfaction.

- [Data-Driven-Marketing-for-Customer-Acquisition](https://github.com/charanakash/Data-Driven-Marketing-for-Customer-Acquisition)
<br> Bank X sought to increase loan conversions among existing depositors. By leveraging data analytics, the marketing team segmented customers and implemented personalized campaigns across digital channels (email, mobile app, social media, website). This data-driven approach significantly boosted conversion rates, improved ROI, and provided valuable insights into customer behavior, enhancing future marketing strategies.

- [Predicting Patient Conditions using Biomechanics Data](https://github.com/charanakash/Predicting-Patient-Conditions-using-Biomechanics-Data)
<br> This project involved developing an AI/ML model to predict patient conditions using anonymized biomechanics data. The task included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing various supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. The model achieved 90% accuracy in classifying patient conditions, providing valuable insights for medical research and potentially improving patient diagnosis and treatment.

- [Vehicle-Silhouette-Classification](https://github.com/charanakash/Vehicle-Silhouette-Classification)
<br> This project aimed to classify vehicle silhouettes. High-dimensional data posed a challenge. To address this, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality while preserving key information. Classification models (SVM, k-NN) were trained on both original and PCA-transformed data. Results showed a slight improvement in accuracy (30%) with PCA, demonstrating the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction for vehicle classification.

- [Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-Telecom](https://github.com/charanakash/Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-Telecom)
<br> A telecom company grappled with high customer churn, impacting revenue. To address this, a predictive machine learning model was developed. This model analyzed customer data, identified key churn drivers like contract expiration and high charges, and enabled proactive retention strategies. By implementing targeted offers and improving services, the company achieved an 85% accurate churn prediction and significantly reduced customer churn, boosting revenue and improving customer satisfaction.
